Jupyter Notebooks present a powerful way to run Python code interactively
from anywhere in a web browser environment. Because of the large size of
data files in use at Jefferson Lab, there are significant benefits to using
Jupyter Notebooks on [jupyter.jlab.org](https://jupyter.jlab.org) to access
data files on the large file data storage systems directly.

At the end of this lesson you will be able to:

1. Create new Jupyter Notebooks on Jefferson Lab's Jupyter server.
1. Increase functionality by installing additional Python packages.
1. Use Git for version control of Jupyter Notebooks.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> Learners need to understand the concepts of files and directories
> (including the working directory), have a basic understanding of
> the Python programming language, and of the Jupyter (IPython) Notbeook
> interface before tackling this lesson. The commands in this lesson
> pertain to **Python 3**.
>
> Learners should ensure that they are part of the `jupyterusers` group
> on the Jefferson Lab scientific computing system. Use the `groups`
> command in an interactive session to check if you are a member of this
> group.

### Getting Started
To get started, follow the directions in the "[Setup](setup/)" tab to
download the initial set of Jupyter Notebook to your working directory
and follow any installation instructions.
