Jupyter Notebooks present a powerful way to run Python code interactively
from anywhere in a web browser environment. Because of the large size of
data files in use at Jefferson Lab, there are significant benefits to using
Jupyter Notebooks on [jupyter.jlab.org](https://jupyter.jlab.org) to access
data files on the large file data storage systems directly.

At the end of this lesson you will be able to:

1. Create new Jupyter Notebooks on Jefferson Lab's Jupyter server.
1. Increase functionality by installing additional Python packages.
1. Use Git for version control of Jupyter Notebooks.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> Learners need to understand the concepts of files and directories
> (including the working directory), have a basic understanding of
> the Python programming language, and of the Jupyter (IPython) Notbeook
> interface before tackling this lesson. The commands in this lesson
> pertain to **Python 3**.
>
> Learners should ensure that they are part of the `jupyterusers` unix group
> on the Jefferson Lab scientific computing system. Use the `groups`
> command in an interactive session to check if you are a member of this
> group.

### Getting Started

To get started, follow the directions in the "[Setup](setup/)" tab to
ensure that you are in the `jupyterusers` unix group.

In order to speed up the entry of notebooks, later in the lesson we will
download an initial set of Jupyter notebooks to your working directory on the
server.
